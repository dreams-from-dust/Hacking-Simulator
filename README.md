# Hacking Simulator

A JavaScript-based web application that simulates a terminal-style hacking process for educational purposes. This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous functions and promises to create a dynamic, theatrical user experience.

**Disclaimer:** This is a front-end simulator created purely for a portfolio project. It has no actual hacking functionality and is intended for demonstration purposes only.

### Key Features

* **Terminal-Style Display:** The UI mimics a command-line interface with a classic dark theme and bright green text.
* **Asynchronous Messaging:** The JavaScript uses a `Promise` and `async/await` to display a sequence of messages with realistic, random delays.
* **Dynamic Animations:** The messages include a blinking cursor-like animation, and a final "SYSTEM HACKED" message appears with a screen flash effect.
* **Modern CSS:** The project uses CSS to handle the styling, including a green text glow and a final dramatic red flash animation.

### Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
